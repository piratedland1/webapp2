= The most advanced WordPress plugin for removing duplicate pages, posts and any custom post type. =

Remove Duplicate Posts is a simple yet powerful plugin that allows you to remove duplicate pages, posts and any custom post type with just one click. 

Why spend hours and hours doing the mundane task of removing duplicate posts and pages when you can do it in seconds?

= How does it work? =
The process is straightforward and requires only two minutes to set up:

* Select the post type for which you would like the duplicates.
* Select options like "Match exact title" or "Title contains" to filter your searches.
* Select posts status (Publish, draft, etc.)
* Delete duplicate posts individually or in bulk.

Once you decide which duplicates to delete from your website, sit back and relax as the plugin works its magic. The progress bar will let you know how much the process is completed. 


= Features =
